        bio: "Ephraim was born on 1689-08-02. He died in 1741 at the age of 51 years. Ephraim was the son of Dennett, John and Sherburne, Amy. He married , Catherine. The youngest child of John and Amy was Ephraim, who was born Aug. 2, 1689, and lived with his mother until she died. He controlled the land on the main property along today's roadway, Dennett Street. Ephraim Dennett became the most politically active of the Dennetts. He served as a selectman from 1715 to 1718 and representative to the legislative house from 1718 to 1728. Newington was separated from Porstmouth in 1713, and Ephraim's land was on the edge of Portsmouth. In 1732, Ephraim was appointed to the Governor's Council at the time that Richard Waldron controlled politics, from the death of Lt. Governor John Wentworth until Benning Wentworth was named Royal Governor of the 'old colony. Ephraim Sr. married Catherine and had at least five children, of whom Ephraom Jr, born July 22, 1718 was the eldest."

Near the center, surrounded by classmates with bobbed hair, sat Elizabeth Ann Virgil 26, who a few months later would be the first African-American to earn a bachelors degree from UNH. Thus did the university become desegregated: quietly, uneventfully, without fanfare or noticeable dissent. In 1951, she joined UNH, where she typed reports from data collected by soil conservation scientists. She found the work interesting--especially later on when women were allowed out into the field--and she stayed for 22 years.'
